# rmdup
Archive of a program I made to remove duplicate files.

I often do `rmdup ~/Downloads` to remove re-downloaded PDF files.

# Help

Prune duplicate files

positional arguments:
  path

options:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -n, --dryrun     pretend to run, useful for testing.

```
